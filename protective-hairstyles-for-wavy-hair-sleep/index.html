<p>Pineapple hairstyle for long hair. I was wondering if anyone had any protective hair styles for my hair type? As you incorporate more protective “night” hairstyles into your regimen, we also recommend wearing a silk scarf, satin bonnet, silk pillowcase, or alternative headwrap to cover (and “protect”) your hair overnight. My favorites to use are devacurl set it free or the sheamoisure yucca &amp; baobob thickening mist. 50+ InstagramApproved Protective Hairstyles to Try.</p>
