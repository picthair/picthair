<p>A quiff hairstyle is somewhat like the pompadour and undercuts as it is shaved or short on the sides and the back and longer on the top, but the styling process of a quiff hairstyle shakes things up and makes it different from other haircuts. It is very suited for men with long curly hair. The quiff only really works for guys with straight long hair, or occasionally those with wavy hair, but guys with long curly hair will probably need to sit this one out. To get this trendy look, use a good pomade, wax, or styling gel product to playfully spike up the top part of your cut. 50 Cute Hairstyles For Naturally Curly Hair.</p>
