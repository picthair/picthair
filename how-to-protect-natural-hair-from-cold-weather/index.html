<p>While the cold weather can inspire us to cozy up next to the fire, it can also take its toll on our skin and hair. I would opt for a more heavy conditioner in the winter, and then something lighter in the summer. At night, tie hair in a silk scarf, bonnet or hair buff as you would your natural hair, and sleep on silk or satin pillowcases. This will serve as a treatment and help the hair from drying or breaking. How to Protect Yourself in Extremely Cold Weather SELF.</p>
