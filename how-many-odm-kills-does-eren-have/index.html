<p>How many titan did eren killed in his human form i find it hard to believe that he only killed one please clarify ty. Zeke can turn humans into pure titans and he can control them since he has a royal blood while eren currently holds three titan powers. He originated from the liberio internment zone and possessed the ability to transform into the colossal titan, making him one of the greatest. Zekezeke is more powerful than eren while eren is stronger than zeke. Tenchi�s Thoughts Shingeki no Kyojin episode 16 People.</p>
