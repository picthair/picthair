<p>Singer rihanna is the queen of protective styles and we�re loving this pretty braided ponytail. I have read so many different things that say that a bun is the most protective style to wear 3c/4a hair in but i find it�s just the opposite for me. These braid styles protect while being simpler, easy to maintain look while also chic and current fashion: I have never tried them personally but i love the look of them compared to regular box braids.

<p>Straight (1a, 1b, 1c)wavy (2a, 2b, 2c)curly (3a, 3b)kinky (4a, 4b) what earlier versions of this system allegedly failed to address was type 3c hair, and apparently, unfortunate oversight, as there was a considerable number of women who fell between super curly, which was a 3b, but not kinky, which would be a 4a. Twist sets are a great natural style that keeps your hair protected, stylish, and is very versatile. The only thing about knotless is i feel like it wouldn’t last long and would start getting frizzy at the roots compared to regular box braids. This style is perfect for embracing your natural hair and keeping it protected and moisturized. Fulani Tribe Inspired Hairstyle NaturalHair 3c 4a .</p>
