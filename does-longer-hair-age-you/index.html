<p>I didn’t really have a choice. Given that hair grows a little less than half an inch per month, hair that is 12 inches long has been exposed to almost three years of ultraviolet light, friction from brushing, heat from blow dryers and curling irons, and chemicals used to coloring, perm, or straighten the hair. Long hair, if not cut and styled right can have an aging effect on some women and that just has to do with estethics, vertical and horizental lines, points of focus and the balance of it all. It may take a little longer, but you will cause less damage. Pin by SOFIA (•_•) MARTINEZ on AGE HAS NO LIMIT.</p>
