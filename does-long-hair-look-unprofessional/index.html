<p>Does long, thick hair look unprofessional on a 40 yo woman? Does long, thick hair look unprofessional on a 40 yo woman? It would be professional if you put it up in a twist or bun but that could be a lot more effort or not look good with your face. At first itï¿½ll be weird not having long hair, but soon youï¿½ll remember some of the joys of short hair, like the fact that itï¿½s way easier to wash, the fact that it doesnï¿½t get in your face, the fact that you donï¿½t have to worry about how you look with a ponytail when youï¿½re a guy, etc. Look Trendy and Professional With Modern Business Hairstyles.</p>
