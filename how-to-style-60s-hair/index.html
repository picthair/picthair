<p>60s hairstyles for short hair are all about bouncy and defined curls. Tease hair at the root from front hairline to crown, then smooth surface with a brush. Slowly tapering the cut down to the neck with no abrupt, choppy layers gives the hair a softer, more polished, and rounded look. As for a styling tip? 60�s inspired makeup at Moschino FW 18 Sixties hair.</p>
