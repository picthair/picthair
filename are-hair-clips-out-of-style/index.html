<p>The claw clips are made of fibre and are available in various colours and designs. Snap clips are really for casual looks, because they�re basically about securing layers or pieces of hair that would otherwise fall out of a ponytail or half up/updo. The style takes about 10 seconds to create, no heat styling required, and even brushing is optional. Snap clips are good for securing pieces of hair that are any type and texture. thanks for bringing me out tonight thechainsmokers 🦋🦋.</p>
