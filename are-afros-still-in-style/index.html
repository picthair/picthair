The 70s were an interesting decade in terms of hair, with everything from short afros to long dreadlocks and mullets to feathered 70s hairstyles men. Afros are a lot like the moon. You could wear an afro as your hair type for your whole life, or you could wear it as a hairstyle for just one day. Pin by Still House on Still House Jewelry Minimalist.</p>
