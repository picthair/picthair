<p>Eren died by an attack from levi and mikasa in which levi blew erens teeth open with a thunder spear and mikasa flew threw the opening and cut erens head from his spine ,which sat inside of the founding titans mouth.

Eren has died officially, and this means that the titan power is over (saving all those who were forced to transform in the final chapter). She is always close to him. He was confirmed dead when the unresponsive head was brought towards armin, and the two childhood friends mourn for the loss of their friend.</p>
