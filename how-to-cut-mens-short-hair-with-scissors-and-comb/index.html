<p>It’s important to keep your scissors blade moving as you cut each section of hair for smooth and consistent ends. So i�m going to use my scissor and comb on a top of one another. Hold it between your index and middle finger, slide your fingers up to the length you want, and snip the hair at an angle with haircutting scissors so it. Comb the man�s hair so any knots are worked out of it. Pin on Men�s Hairstyles.</p>
