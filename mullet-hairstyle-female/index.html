<p>While the look was more common among men in the era of new wave, many bold women also sported the look. A mullet shag can be cut in a more traditional classic way, or paired with undercuts, shaved designs, creative hair colors, curls or shaglet bangs. This haircut is versatile, as it can be worn by both women and men. This time around, of course, the haircut is not reserved for just rockstars and bikers.
