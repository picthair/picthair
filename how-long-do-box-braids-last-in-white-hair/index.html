<p>Box braids can last from 4 to 6 weeks. How long do box braids take? I�d recommend 6 to 8 weeks and if you want to go longer, you have to really take good care of it to avoid a lot of breakage. This is necessary for doing box braids on thin hair as well as for white hair because hair predominately of this grade is silky and shiny so braiding on damp hair will give you neat results as well as your choice of braiding hair. makayla london on Instagram “switched up so quick 🤧 keep.</p>
