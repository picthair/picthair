<p>Eren dies at the conclusion of the manga attack on titan. Chapter 139’s majority content consists of eren’s last conversation with armin. Fast forward to the last few chapters of the story and eren’s fatal end seemed inevitable. Therefore, eren is technically dead in attack on titan, but he does not stay dead.

<p>The manga is finished so if this was a question relating to the manga i’d give a different answer, but since the question specifies “season 4” which is only halfway through, the answer will have to be. While many are speculating the makers will change the end. Yes, eren is dead and for real this time. No, eren does not die in ‘attack on titan’s episode titled ‘judgement.’.
