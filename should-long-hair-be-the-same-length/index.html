<p>I�m going to wait until my hair grows at least 3 more inches then i�ll consider a trim or cut to make it more even. In this piece, we’ll assume that short hair is any hair that doesn’t reach shoulder length. It�s time for a new look that wows all hair fans around you. August 16th, 2012, 04:09 pm #9.
