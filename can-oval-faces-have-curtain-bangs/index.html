The curtain (or bardot bangs, if a little shorter) are one of my favourites because they’re so versatile on a variety of face shapes. Full bangs for oval faces @ cortesfeminin0s oval is one of the only face shapes that can pull off very full bangs. Pin on Just a Girl Living in a Material World.</p>

<p>In general the goal with bangs is to find a style that helps make your face appear more oval while also bringing out your eyes and enhancing your overall hairstyle. Oval faces are considered the “ideal” face shape for haircuts, because almost every haircut looks good. Think of these like longer curtain bangs, just helping to bring more definition to areas of the face. For women with oval face shape, curtain bangs can look really cool and amazing.
