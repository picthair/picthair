Who is the strongest titan in Attack on Titan? Is it Eren? From epicdope.com</p>
<p>Eren yeager is the strongest titan and titan shifter in the attack on titan universe. He is straightforward and says what he thinks. However, the reason he’s so high up on this list is because of his ability to command legions of titans with the power of the founding titan. Eren also smashed down the war hammer and also ate emma tybur.</p>

<p>Eren yeager is the strongest titan and titan shifter in the attack on titan universe. Moreover zeke proved to be able to defeat reiner without effort, and, being called the strongest warrior, probably his power in combat is second only to the warhammer titan and the founder titan. Although eren lands the first punch, reiner dominates the first part of the fight. However, that’s no the prime reason his enemies fear him so much. Eren has better agility, speed, and techniques than reiner.</p>
