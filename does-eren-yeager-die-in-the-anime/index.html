<p>The attack on titan fandom still can�t come to a consensus about the curse of ymir, a rule which states that a titan shifter can live a mere 13 years after acquiring their titan powers, and what this means for our protagonist, eren jaeger, who possesses more than one shifter power. The founding titan ymir saved zeke by the phenomenon known as “paths,” which was mentioned by an owl talking to grisha yeager. This is the exact thing that happened when gabi braun fatally shot eren yeager in the head. Many fans found it impossible to believe that mikasa would be the one killing him, especially when she had been protecting him throughout the anime.

<p>Maybe what eren sees in his dream in the manga is the last line mikasa says to him as he dies? For fans, this could be a hard truth to deal with since we�ve been following his journey to avenge his parents� death and discover the world outside the walls from the very beginning. Yes, she gets depressed with eren�s sudden disappearance, chops her hair off and loses her edge, but nobody seems to notice. This means that he got in the titan�s stomach without any damage to his spine, keeping his powers from being taken. Ich Bin Dein [Eren x Reader] in 2021 Eren jäger, Anime.</p>

<p>In this part, we’ll only clarify that eren yeager dies in attack on titan, and that it occurs in the manga’s and anime’s final arcs. Screenshot by kristine tuting/one esports.
