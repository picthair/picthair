<p>Eren is the last person historia is going to marry. All members of the titan race can only live for an additional 13 years after they awaken to their powers because the curse of ymir says that none of her descendants can live longer than she did. After making it inside eren�s titan mouth thanks to assistance from levi, mikasa decapitated eren�s human body and kissed him goodbye for the first and last time. Despite this, it is possible for eren and historia to marry — more out of duty and obligation than love. Eren x Annie By Your Side COMPLETED PHTimes2019.</p>
