<p>Eren jaeger is the protagonist of attack on titan. When it comes to attack on titan, the most popular coupling lies with eren yeager and mikasa, but it doesn�t look like the series� creator is totally behind the pairing. From eren’s side, mikasa is the one destined to get married to him. And it�s also not common for mangakas or people who make manga to. Pin by Ayşenur Sarıkoç on Riren Ereri, Attack on titan.</p>
