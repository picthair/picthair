<p>I understand there are concerns about creating volume but this is one of the beauties of having short hair. A pixie cut can make you look younger by bringing out your features, especially your cheekbones and eyes! The short hair and longer front provide a youthful touch to anyone’s appearance, including men who are a little older. If you can still achieve good, thick length on top, but your crown may be thinning a bit, this is a great men�s haircut to make the best of what you have. Look younger with short hair Does short hair make you.</p>
