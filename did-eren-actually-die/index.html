<p><strong>Did Eren Actually Die</strong>, His death adds basically no value to the story, while being alive is worth far more both thematically and narratively. As his titans begin the destruction of marley, eren remembers the death of his mother and reiterates his desire to destroy every last one of his enemies in the world. As he loses consciousness, one of the titans he created approaches him and tears its stomach apart to store zeke in it. Eren died at the end of chapter 138.</p>

<p>Eren is not going to die for many reasons: The lead character, eren yeager, ends up joining the military with his two childhood friends mikasa and armin after the titans break through the wall and attack his hometown. In the shortest of terms, mikasa killed eren so that not only would the rumbling cease, but also it means that the power of the titans could end. It is not specified that eren intentionally forced dina to eat his own mother, but it can be argued that, by letting bertholdt live, eren still caused indirectly carla�s death.</p>

<p>Yes, because eren is afflicted by ymir’s curse, which dictates that a titan shifter can only survive for 13 years after inheriting their powers. Eren dies at the very end of the series. Episode 78 of the final season of attack on titan saw eren jaeger have his head blown off, but the character may not be dead for long because his brother zeke wants to use the founder�s power to.

<p>Since a titan shifter’s body recovers when they transform,and all it took to transform was a touch from zeke,eren was perfectly alright after he transformed into the founder,or founding titan,i rather call it founder though.

As far as the anime is concerned, by all accounts, eren will likely succumb to this eventually if he does manage to brave the massive conflict that is apparent in the future of the series. For fans, this could be a hard truth to deal with since we�ve been following his journey to avenge his parents� death and discover the world outside the walls from the very beginning.
