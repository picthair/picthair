Unfortunately, this leaves us with a thirsty, achy section of scalp that is often thinning and breaking and screaming out for help while the rest of our tresses flourish. Never did i expect that in 2021 we would see one of the biggest arguments on tiktok be between gen z and millennials over…the middle part vs the side part. I part my hair on the left and when i pull my hair straight back you can see that the left side of my hairline goes back further than the right. 2.5 months in. The middle won�t grow. Not sure if it.</p>

<p>Part your hair in its new spot, and then blow dry it in that direction to reinforce the part. I sleep on my back to try to keep everything in place, which is a big sacrifice for a diehard stomach sleeper. After quite a few trials and many many errors i realized that the way you part your hair depends a lot on the shape of your face. I usually part my hair from the right side, just because i am used to it. Please anything I can do that will help my thick.</p>
