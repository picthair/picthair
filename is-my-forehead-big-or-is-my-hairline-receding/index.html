<p>There are different hairstyles that men and women can choose. Surprised to the engagement i received on my 1st hair video for big foreheads a year ago, i realize a better overall video would have been not only telling, but showing people how to actually achieve. I always had my hair very short,covering receding temples,so it didnt bother me at all. Receding hairline can be a nightmare to both men and women.
