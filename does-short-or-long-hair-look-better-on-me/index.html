<p><strong>Does Short Or Long Hair Look Better On Me</strong>, Long or short, that is the question! Long hair is more versatile than short hair. The results tell you what to do with it. All you have to do is to visit an experienced hairdresser and take into account some useful tips!</p>

Do These Celebs Look Better With Short or Long Hair? Byrdie From byrdie.com</p>
<p>As civilization and technology advanced, and the population in one area became denser, short hair became preferred as long hair was harder to keep clean and prevent the spreading of fleas and lice. A good cut makes us feel attractive, just like a pair of sinfully expensive new pumps. And that is where the radiance comes in. Take your measurement from the intersection of the pencil and ruler.</p>

<p>If the measurement of where the pencil meets the ruler is lesser than 2.25 inches, then short hair will suit your face. Hold it parallel to the ground. Over 2.25 inches, a longer cut might be a better option. The longer hair is of me now, short is from last year. Just make sure your haircut does not go shorter in the front and longer in the back.</p>
