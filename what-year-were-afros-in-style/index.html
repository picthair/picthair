<p>Helllllll yeaaaaahhhh it is back in style. In the late 1960s and 1970s afros were considered expressions of cultural identity as well as a rebellion against conforming to the beauty norms of white culture. Earlier this year, construction crews and contractors were tackling the bigger jobs of redoing the walls and flooring and fixing the plumbing. I think that there are many reasons, including the recyling of fashion trends, for the (still moderately)increase in black folks wearing their hair in afros.</p>

<p>For me i didn�t care a damn about this i did it because i hated relaxed hair. In those years the style represented a celebration of black beauty and a repudiation of eurocentric beauty standards. During that time, the black panthers and civil rights activists such as angela davis sported the natural style and gave it political meaning as they fought for racial equality. And this year (2011), i�ve been seeing more young african american women (and african american men) sportin� large angela davis style afros. But with a little patience and proper care, you can have the hair you�ve always wanted.</p>
