<p><strong>Who Does Eren End Up Marrying</strong>, She does have a baby, but since the identity of her husband was never revealed, we don’t actually know if it’s jean, which means that we don’t know whether the baby is jean’s. Despite this, it is possible for eren and historia to marry — more out of duty and obligation than love. In other words, after kruger and eren mentioned attack titan/eren said founding titan, the focus was back on the present as the connection to the paths came to an end. Finally, with eren and historia‘s marriage, attack on titan reached a happy ending with all characters paired up and living happily ever after.</p>

<p>Mikasa appears for the first time in year 845 somewhere inside wall maria. She does have a baby, but since the identity of her husband was never revealed, we don’t actually know if it’s jean, which means that we don’t know whether the baby is jean’s. Isayama does use armin to voice the conventionally ethical side, meaning that normally, a woman in mikasa’s place should move on, yet in the end, mikasa is depicted as still wanting eren. Today is friday, so he suggested earlier that they go out to have some fun.</p>

<p>Even armin in this chapter more or less says that mikasa, while she should forget eren and move on, because he broke her heart, most likely won’t ever be able to forget eren, that’s why he punches him. Yes, eren does love mikasa as she is definitely the most important woman in his life after his mother. People gave too much importance to her character and seriously thought she needed to complete an arc that already ended years ago. The only reason people believe that will happen is because some readers see women as prizes to be won and since jean likes her, they expect them to end up together, even though they�ve barely interacted and mikasa has always been in love with eren.

<p>When the pair were younger, eren often looked after his adoptive sister once her parents were murdered, but mikasa separated herself from. She does have a baby, but since the identity of her husband was never revealed, we don’t actually know if it’s jean, which means that we don’t know whether the baby is jean’s. There�s nothing in the manga that suggests they�re even friends, let alone they�ll end up marrying. But for historia, she didn’t hesitate to punch him back into reality and ended up saving eren from his own death wish as well as being chained. Can you see Eren getting married to Mikasa? Just curious.</p>
